Project Summary
This project appears to be a Helm chart for deploying NGINX in a Kubernetes cluster. Based on the directory structure, it seems you've created a custom Helm chart called nginx-chart.

Helm charts provide a way to package Kubernetes resources into a single unit that can be easily deployed, upgraded, and managed. The NGINX chart likely includes deployments, services, and possibly other resources needed to run NGINX web server in Kubernetes.

What Has Been Done
Created a Helm chart structure in the nginx-chart directory
Likely includes templates for NGINX deployment and service definitions
Set up configuration values to customize the deployment
Running NGINX with LoadBalancer on Minikube
To expose your NGINX deployment using a LoadBalancer service with Minikube, follow these steps:

Make sure Minikube is running:

minikube status

Install the Helm chart (if not already installed):
helm install nginx-release ./nginx-chart

To access the NGINX service using Minikube's service command:
minikube service nginx-service

The minikube service command will automatically open a browser window with the service URL. It creates a tunnel to the service and makes it accessible from your local machine, even though Minikube doesn't support real LoadBalancer implementations by default.

You can also get the service URL without launching the browser:

This will print the URL that you can use to access your NGINX deployment.
